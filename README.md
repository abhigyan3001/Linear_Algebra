# Linear Algebra Tools in Pure Python

This repository contains a lightweight linear algebra module implemented **from scratch using only core Python**.  
The goal of this project is to build intuition for fundamental concepts in vector algebra without relying on libraries like NumPy.

As an MSc Mathematics student, writing these operations manually helps reinforce the geometric and algebraic ideas behind vector spaces while also improving Python design skills.

## 🔧 Features Implemented

### ✔️ Vector Class (`vectors.py`)
A clean and mathematical representation of a vector with:

- Vector addition  
- Vector subtraction  
- Scalar multiplication  
- Dot product  
- Euclidean norm  
- Equality comparison  
- Nicely formatted printing  

All operations follow the mathematical definitions exactly and are written using simple Python lists.

---

## 🧪 Testing with PyTest

The project includes a comprehensive test file (`test_vectors.py`) to verify the correctness of each operation.

## 🎓 Purpose of This Project

This project is part of my effort to deepen my understanding of:

- Python programming  
- Object-oriented design    
- Mathematical software development  
- Test-driven development  

Instead of relying on pre-built libraries, I wanted to explore how these operations work internally and write them in my own mathematical style.

This also serves as a base for future extensions, such as:

- Matrix operations  
- Linear transformations  
- Gradient descent  
- Optimization algorithms  
- Numerical methods  
- Linear regression from scratch

## 🚀 Future Work

Planned extensions include:

- `Matrix` class with row/column operations  
- Gaussian elimination  
- Projection and angle between vectors  
- L1 / L∞ norms  
- Orthogonality checks  
- Gram–Schmidt algorithm  

These additions will gradually turn this into a small educational linear algebra library.
